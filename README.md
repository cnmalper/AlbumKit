AlbumKit is an app to apply some filters to your photos. It is possible to make cropped photos, apply your filter and save to your library on your iPhone.

TOCropViewController -> https://github.com/TimOliver/TOCropViewController | (Created by Tim Oliver)

TOCropViewController is an open-source UIViewController subclass to crop out sections of UIImage objects, as well as perform basic rotations. It is excellent for things like editing profile pictures, or sharing parts of a photo online. It has been designed with the iOS Photos app editor in mind, and as such, behaves in a way that should already feel familiar to users of iOS.
